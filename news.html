                        We have recently observed a surge in false claims and misinformation circulating about our
                        platform. These claims appear to be part of an attempt by bad parties to deceive Quopi users
                        into disclosing their account details by offering fake alternative ways to withdraw active
                        stakes - a function that we do not offer.

                        </li>
                        <li>2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts for an extra layer of security.

                        Harnessing the Future: Crypto Bot Whitelist Expansion and a Revealing Roadmap
                        <br>
                        In a world where digital advancements are rapidly reshaping the financial landscape, our
                        platform remains at the forefront, not just keeping pace but setting the tempo. Recently, a wave
                        of excitement has been sent through our community as two major announcements promise to chart a
                        course for an exhilarating future. Firstly, an exclusive group of individuals received their
                        golden tickets — emails confirming their early access to our much-anticipated crypto bot
                        whitelist. Meanwhile, for those who missed the initial chance, there’s a reason to stay
                        optimistic: an additional 4,000 spots are slated to open on November 20th. And secondly, we have
                        unfurled our platform's roadmap, a testament to our commitment to innovation and our community's
                        prosperity. Let's delve deeper into each of these thrilling developments and explore what they
                        mean for you.

                        Beyond the immediate excitement of the whitelist expansion lies a broader vision for our
                        platform's future. We've officially released our roadmap, a strategic blueprint brimming with
                        innovative and ambitious plans that are set to unfold. This roadmap isn’t just a list of
                        targets; it's a narrative of our journey, reflecting our dedication to building a platform that
                        not only meets but exceeds the aspirations of our users.

                        roadmap lays out a series of initiatives that promise to elevate your trading experience. We're
                        looking beyond the horizon, setting our sights on harnessing emerging trends and providing a
                        suite of tools that will empower our users to succeed in the evolving world of crypto.

                        calendars for November 20th, as we're expanding the whitelist to include an additional 4,000
                        spots! This isn’t just about giving more users a sneak peek; it's about cultivating a community

                        world — the SIGMA Expo in Malta, scheduled from November 13-17. This year, the expo is not just
                        a showcase of new technology but also a landmark of new beginnings, as we proudly announce our
                        attendance in collaboration with our latest partners.

                        spotlight on emerging trends and fosters discussions that can lead to the next big breakthrough.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this spirit of discovery and collaboration, we're teaming up with our new partners to bring a
                        combined vision to life. Together, we're working on something truly special, leveraging each
                        other's strengths to present solutions and ideas that we believe will have a significant impact
                        on the industry.
                        <br>

                        Whether you are an industry veteran or a curious onlooker, your presence is valued in the
                        dialogue that shapes our technological landscape.

                        the next product launch or the latest buzzword; it’s about the connections we make and the
                        horizons we expand.

                        Our trading bot is not active today, despite it being a Monday. We are here to clarify that the
                        reason behind the bot's inactivity is due to a federal holiday in the United States -
                        Presidents' Day.

                        <br>
                        Presidents Day is observed on the third Monday of February each year, and it honors the
                        birthdays of two former American presidents, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. On this day,
                        the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) remains closed, which means that there is no trading activity
                        on the exchange.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As our trading bot is designed to operate on the NYSE, it is unable to carry out any trades on
                        Presidents' Day. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and want to assure our
                        investors that the bot will resume trading as usual on the next business day.

                        The Quopi AI trading bot is designed to only operate during specific times, from 9:30 AM to 4:00
                        PM Eastern Time. During these hours, the bot will only trade on the New York Stock Exchange
                        (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. This decision was made because these are our work hours, and it allows us
                        to constantly monitor the bot's activities.

                        provide retail traders with a reliable and profitable trading solution, and this recent

                    <p>
                        Recently, a successful beta test of an AI trading bot was conducted with 30 early users. The
                        test results were extremely positive and the developers of the bot are now planning to roll out
                        the full version in the next month.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One of the main challenges that the bot faced during the beta test was incorporating new data
                        into its trading algorithm in real-time. To solve this issue, the team of developers implemented
                        a machine learning technique that allowed the bot to constantly adapt and improve its
                        performance based on new data inputs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another important decision made during the beta test was to remove Elliot Wave theory as an
                        analysis tool. The team found that its integration into the trading algorithm reduced the
                        overall quality of the bot's trading results.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a result of these improvements, the beta test was a huge success, with the AI trading bot
                        demonstrating remarkable accuracy in its trades. The developers are now confident that the full
                        version of the bot will be able to provide even more impressive results for its users.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In conclusion, the beta test of this AI trading bot was a major milestone, with the team
                        overcoming some significant challenges and making important decisions that will ensure the
                        success of the bot in the future.

                        We've found that we can radically improve the capabilities of our day trading bot. This was done
                        by fine-tuning decision-making with a curated dataset of fewer than 100 examples of specific
                        behavior values in certain candlestick arrangements.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It, in combination with historical data previously fed to the AI and daily market indicator
                        informational updates, has radically decreased the volatility and unpredictable nature of the
                        bot's performance. This development contradicts the hypothesis that the larger the model, the
                        more effective the technique becomes.
